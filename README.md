# AngularApp
=======
# OhangaApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

This app pulls student data from an online source, organizes it, and displays it on the server where a user can use search bars to filter through and find a specific student. Clicking the plus/minus sign in the upper right corner by each student's name will show/hide further information about the student. When this is expanded, tags can be added to each student, and by using the tag (second) search bar, the user can filter students by added tags, while also using the name (first) search bar to more narrowly sort. 

## Dependencies 
Run 'npm install' to install node_modules 
Run 'ng add @angular/material' to install Angular Material
